set yourself in the path of your project
type: "leni" or "leni --help" to display command manual

to initialize Leni type:

>> leni init
which in turn will do two things:
        --> check in .leni/ folder exists, in that case will give you 
                [HEAD id]
                [Number of items (i.e. files in the project)]
                [last modification date and time]

        --> if .leni/ does not exist, it will create it along with a folder named
                after the new HEAD id with a .lni extension.
                it will write 
                [new HEAD id]
                [Number of items (i.e. files in the project)]
                [modification date and time]

>> leni status
will display the status of the whole project, with all of its versions
        --> HEAD id --> "[HEAD]" {%No. files}
            prev id --> "message of description of change" {%No. files}
            prev id --> "message of description of change" {%No. files}
            prev id --> "message of description of change" {%No. files}
            prev id --> "message of description of change" {%No. files}
            .
            .
            .
